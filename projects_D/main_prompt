As an engineer using VS Code, your task is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Pygame library. When running the program, you should be able to play the game within a Pygame window. The game should offer a single-player mode where the computer acts as the opponent.

To accomplish this, you need to:

Set up the game window using Pygame in VS Code.
Implement the game logic, including the game board and player markers.
Create functions to handle player moves and check for win or draw conditions.
Display the game board and markers in the Pygame window.
Enable player interaction by capturing mouse input for moves.
Implement the computer opponent's move logic, such as random selection or a more sophisticated algorithm.
Continuously update the game display and handle game termination conditions.
Your goal is to build a functional and visually appealing Tic-Tac-Toe game that offers an enjoyable single-player experience against the computer opponent. Feel free to enhance the game by adding additional features or improving the user interface.

Set up the Pygame window: Initialize Pygame, create a window, and set the window size and title.

Create the game board: Design the game board using Pygame's drawing functions or load images for each cell. You can represent the game board as a 3x3 grid.

Handle user input: Detect mouse clicks or keyboard events to allow players to make their moves on the game board. Map the input to the corresponding cell on the grid.

Implement game logic: Track the state of the game, including the positions of the X and O markers on the grid. Check for winning conditions or a draw after each move.

Display the game state: Update the Pygame window to reflect the current state of the game board, including the markers and any messages or prompts.

Handle game restarts: Provide an option for players to restart the game once it ends. Reset the game board and clear the markers to start a new game.

Implement game loop: Create a loop that continuously updates the display, handles user input, and checks for game events until the game is over or the user exits the window.

Add visual effects and animations (optional): You can enhance the game's visual appeal by adding animations for moves, highlighting winning cells, or incorporating sound effects.

Ensure you have the necessary modules, such as Pygame, installed and properly set up in your VS Code environment.
